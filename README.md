# Fall-detection
Fall detection using MPU6050 with CNN method. Below is all the code related to my project, starting from acquiring raw accelerometer data (X, Y, Z axes). The accelerometer data is then uploaded to a computer or Raspberry Pi using UDP. The system automatically creates CSV files with 500 rows of data every 5 seconds. These CSV files are then converted to spectrograms for the training dataset.

If you want, I can help improve your whole project description or comments in your code as well!
